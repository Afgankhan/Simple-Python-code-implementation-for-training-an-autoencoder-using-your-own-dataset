# Simple-Python-code-implementation-for-training-an-autoencoder-using-your-own-dataset
This Python code uses PyTorch to implement a basic autoencoder for unsupervised learning on a custom dataset. The model compresses and reconstructs data, with adjustable hyperparameters. The trained autoencoder is saved for future use, providing a foundation for unsupervised learning and feature extraction.
